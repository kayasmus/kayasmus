- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @kayasmus
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in boardgames, reading and thinking about jogging
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python by going through Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code, reading Python Crash Course, and freecodecamp. I don't know what I want to specialize in yet and am on the journey to find out.
